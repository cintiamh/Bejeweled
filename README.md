Bejeweled 2 Rules

The objective of Bejeweled 2 is to score points by rearranging gems to form horizontal and vertical lines of three gems or more. Achieve a maximum score by creating as many lines as possible within the given time limit.

The Bejeweled 2 game board is a grilled that is filled with 64 gems. Gems are different colors and are placed randomly on the board. Swap adjacent gems on a horizontal or vertical axis to create a line with three or more gems of the same color. You can only swap gems that will result in a matching line. When you create a line of three or more gems, these gems will disappear and new gems will fill in their places, moving down from the top of the screen. The grid remains filled with 64 gems throughout the entire course of the game and it is your objective to group as many together as possible in the allotted time.

Creating lines of more than 3 gems create special gems. Special gems are great strategic tools:

Power Gems are created when you group together 4 like-gems in a line. A Power Gem, when used in a combination, will explode. In exploding, a Power Gem will blow up all surrounding gems. If one Power Gem blows up another Power Gem, this power gem will also explode.
Hyper Gems are created when you group together 5 like-gems in a line. When you group 5 gems together, 4 will disappear and 1 will remain on the screen as a Hyper Gem. A Hyper Gem is a great strategic tool. When swapped with another gem, they cause all of the gems of the same color on the board to disappear. For instance, if you swap a Hyper gem with a purple gem, it will cause all of the purple gems on the board to disappear.
Scoring a specific number of points will advance you to the next level of the game. As levels advance in Bejeweled 2, point values increase. Additionally, when you advance to a new level the grid will be refilled at random with new gems. If you have any Power Gems or Hyper Gems, they will carry over to the new level.

If during the course of the game you run out of legal moves the grid will refill with new gems. In this case, Power Gems and Hyper Gems will not carry over. While running out of legal moves does not cost you points, it costs you time.

If you do not see any legal moves but the board has not refilled then you can click the Hint Button and you will be shown a legal move on the board. There is a point penalty for using the Hint Button.

Scoring in Bejeweled 2

Points are scored based on the groups that you create:

Each match earns you a base score of 10 points.
If your first match results in a second match then you receive 20 points for the second match.
If your second match results in a third match then you receive 30 points.
For each additional combo match, resulting from a previous match, you receive a score that increases in increments of 10 points.
4-gem rows are worth an additional 10 points.
5-gem rows are worth an additional 20 points.
Receive 75 points for using a Hyper Gem, 20 points for each regular gem the Hyper Gem destroys and 60 points for each Power Gem it destroys.
Additionally, as you advance through the levels you will receive more points, based on point multipliers in every level:

The multiplier in Level 2 is 1.5, so point values are multiplied by 1.5
The multiplier in Level 3 is 2
The multiplier in Level 4 is 2.5
The multiplier in level 5 is 3
The multiplier in level 6 is 3.5
Clicking on the Hint Button will cause you a penalty of 50 points deducted from your score, multiplied by the level multiplier.

Bejeweled 2 Controls

Swap two gems by clicking on the first gem and then on the second gem. In order to swap two gems they must be adjacent on a horizontal or vertical axis.
Gems may also be swapped by clicking and dragging the first gem into the spot of the second gem.
A legal gem swap will result in the resulting line of matching gems disappearing from the board.
If you attempt to make an illegal swap you will hear and error sound and the gems will not be moved.
